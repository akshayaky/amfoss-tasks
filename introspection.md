## Why should you choose me?

I am computer enthusiast and have been learning in the CS  for the past two years though it is mostly limited to programming. I have leanrned C++ and MySQL
through my school education. I also leaned python on my own after the class 12 exams. I have tried my level best in completing the  tasks I completed,though I wish I did the javascript and Go tasks as I have not worked with these languages and could learned them for the tasks. I am dedicated in my work and can spend many hours doing the same.
Though I am interseted in programming and other CS stuff, I was a bit lazy to learn new things other than those taught at school.



## How was I before joining and how am i now?
Before joining I was not actively doing anything other than those taught at school. Even when I planned to do something on my own I didn't learn anything new rather I did something with things I knew already.
But doing the tasks I was ready to learn new things and do them. Before, I thought that I knew everything when I learned one language.But now I know that Computer Science is a vast
field and I knew almost nothing  of it.Before joining here, I checked out the previous amfoss-tasks lists I and thought that I will not able to complete anything except one or two but I worked hard and completed many of them and would have done more if time permitted.


## My comments regarding the Selection Process

I found  doing the tasks to be a great learning experience for me. All of the Tasks could done by learning the required things.
The refernces given for some of the tasks were great.Even though One month time was given to complete the tasks, the clash with the classes greatly affected the tasks.
The telegram groups were great for clearing doubts and for interacting with the mentors and the other students.


## What is my plan for next six months?

I plan to learn atleast one new programming language and to improve upon my python and C++. I am also thinking of learning some AI.
I think I should also concentrate on my college syllabus to get Maximum CGPA in the first year.

## How would I would I contribute back to the club?

I would  work hard for the club. I would try to keep up the  name of the club and give my level best.
I would gain knowlege  and share the knowledge I gain with others. I would give my time and energy for the club.
