## HackerRank

### [Compare the Triplets](/task-2/HackerRank/compare-the-triplets.cpp)

1. Three arrays are created,to store the ratings of Alice and Bob in the first two and the final score of both in the third array.
2. Ratings of both Alice and Bob is input by the user.
3. A function is used to compare the ratings of Alice and Bob and increment the score of the person the higher rating.
4. The score of Alice and Bob is printed.

### [Diagonal Difference](/task-2/HackerRank/diagonal-difference.cpp)

1. The user inputs the number of rows and columns of the square and  its elements.
2. A function is used to calculate the sum of primary and secondary array. Let __x__ be first index and __y__ be the second. Then:
   - for Primary diagonal **y == x**
   - for secondary diagonal **y == n-x-1**
3. Then their difference is calculated and printed.

### [Staircase](/task-2/HackerRank/staircase.cpp)

1. The user input a single integer **n**.
2. A function is used which prints the required staircase pattern.
3. A nested loop is used in which the outer loop and inner loop executes **n** times but "#" is printed only when inner loop variable is greater than **a** else prints " ", where  **a** is equal to **n-1** and is decremented after each outer loop execution.
