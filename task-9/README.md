### The Steps I followed to create my Website

1. Forked the personal-wesite repository.
2. Cloned the repository into my computer.
3. Installed ruby and jekyll gem
4. Ran this command to build the website 
    **bundle exec jekyll serve**
5. Hosting of the website is done by changing the repository name to  username.github.io where username is the GitHub username.
6. I slightly custumised the website, changed the **My Interest** section and changed the **style** to **Dark**
