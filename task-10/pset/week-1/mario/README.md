## Mario

Implement a program that prints two [pyramids](https://lab.cs50.io/cs50/labs/2019/x/mario/more/).


## Approach
1. A do-while loop prompts the user to enter a number between 1 and 8. **n** is taken as input.
2. A nested loop is used to print the pattern.
3. Outer loop executes **n** times and inner loop executes **2*n-1** times.
4. Two variables initialised as **n-1** and **n+2** are used which are incremented and decremented respectively on iteration of the outer loop.
5. The program prints the required pattern for the inputs from 1 to 8.
